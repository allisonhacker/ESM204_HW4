## 2. Analysis

### a) Discounted Utility

```{r}
# discount rate function
disc_fun <- function(y = 0.005, n = 0.5, g = 0.01){
  disc = y + n*g
}

# T = 4.4
disc_4.4 <- years %>% 
  mutate(temp = temp_fun(t = year, T = 4.4),
         econ = econ_fun(temp = temp),
         consum = consum_fun(t = year, econ = econ),
         utility = utility_fun(C = consum),
         disc_utility = utility/((1 + disc_fun())^year))

# NPV under T = 4.4 
npv_4.4 <- sum(disc_4.4$disc_utility)
npv_4.4

# T = 0 
disc_0 <- years %>% 
  mutate(temp = temp_fun(t = year, T = 0),
         econ = econ_fun(temp = temp),
         consum = consum_fun(t = year, econ = econ),
         utility = utility_fun(C = consum),
         disc_utility = utility/((1 + disc_fun())^year))

# NPV under T = 0 
npv_0 <- sum(disc_0$disc_utility)
npv_0

# percent loss in PV from climate change (T = 4.4)
L <- ((npv_0 - npv_4.4)/npv_0)*100
L
```

The present value utility with climate change (T = 4.4) is **198.66**. The present value utility without climate change is **255.27**. The percent loss in present value utility from claimate change (L) is **22.18%**.
